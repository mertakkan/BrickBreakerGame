# Brick Breaker Game

A Java-based brick breaker game with advanced features including multiple obstacle types, special abilities, and a map editor. This project is a modern take on the classic Pong/Arkanoid-style arcade game.

## üéÆ Game Description

Brick Breaker Game is an enhanced version of the classic brick breaker arcade game. Players control a paddle to bounce a ball and destroy various types of obstacles (bricks) while collecting power-ups and avoiding hazards. The game features a custom map editor for creating and saving custom levels, plus a challenging "Ymir" system that periodically introduces random game-changing events.

## ‚ú® Features

### Game Modes
- **Building Mode**: Create custom maps with a visual editor
- **Running Mode**: Play through created or loaded maps
- **Map Save/Load System**: Store and retrieve custom maps from a PostgreSQL database

### Obstacle Types
- **Simple Obstacles** (Wall Maria): Basic bricks with 1 hit point
- **Firm Obstacles** (Stein's Gate): Stronger bricks requiring 2-5 hits
- **Explosive Obstacles** (Pandora's Box): Dangerous bricks that end the game if they reach the paddle
- **Gift Obstacles** (Gift of Uranus): Drop random power-ups when destroyed

### Special Abilities
- **Expansion (E)**: Doubles the paddle width temporarily (30 seconds)
- **Unstoppable (U)**: Ball destroys all obstacles in one hit (30 seconds)
- **Hex (H)**: Activates dual cannons that shoot additional projectiles (30 seconds)
- **Extra Life (C)**: Gained from gift obstacles

### Ymir System
A unique game mechanic that randomly triggers challenging events every 30 seconds:
- **Infinite Void**: Freezes 8 random obstacles temporarily
- **Double Acceleration**: Slows down the ball
- **Hollow Purple**: Spawns 8 new purple obstacles

### Gameplay Features
- **Paddle Rotation**: Rotate the paddle left/right (¬±45¬∞) for strategic ball angles
- **Score System**: Time-based scoring that rewards quick obstacle destruction
- **Lives System**: 3 lives per game
- **Frozen Obstacles**: Temporarily invulnerable obstacles (shown in green)
- **Physics-based Ball Movement**: Realistic collision detection and bouncing
